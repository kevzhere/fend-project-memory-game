## How to play

The game is displayed in a 4 x 4 grid system and contains 8 pair of cards.

Cards will stay up if match correctly, else will flip back down.
Match all 8 pair of cards to win.

You will lose the first star if your pair to move rate is lower than 5% or if you took more than 10 moves without finding a pair.
You will lose the second star if your pair to move rate is lower than 2.5% or if you took more than 16 moves without finding a pair.
